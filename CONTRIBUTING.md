# Development

To run the entire test suite:

```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```

You can also run individual tests for a [submodule](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez#modules) using the `--tests` flag:

```bash
$ ./gradlew :api:test --tests marquez.api.DatasetResourceTest
$ ./gradlew :api:test --tests marquez.service.DatasetServiceTest
$ ./gradlew :api:test --tests marquez.db.DatasetDaoTest
```

Or run tests by category:  

```bash
$ ./gradlew :api:testUnit         # run only unit tests
$ ./gradlew :api:testIntegration  # run only integration tests
$ ./gradlew :api:testDataAccess   # run only data access tests
```

We use [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to format our code. This ensures `.java` files are formatted to comply with [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Make sure your code is formatted before pushing any changes, otherwise CI will fail:

```
$ ./gradlew spotlessApply
```

> **Note:** To make formatting code simple, we recommend installing a [plugin](https://github.com/google/google-java-format#intellij-android-studio-and-other-jetbrains-ides) for your favorite IDE. We also us [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org). Though not required, you might want to install the [plugin](https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview) as well.

# Publish to Local Maven Repository

Use [`publishToMavenLocal`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html#publishing_maven:tasks) to publish artifacts to your local maven repository:

```
$ ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

# Submitting a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)

1. [Fork](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/fork) and clone the repository
2. Make sure all tests pass locally: `./gradlew test`
3. Create a new [branch](#branching): `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-new-feature`
4. Make change on your cool new branch
5. Write a test for your change
6. Make sure `.java` files are formatted: `./gradlew spotlessJavaCheck`
7. Make sure to [sign you work](#sign-your-work)
8. Push change to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/compare)
9. Work with project maintainers to get your change reviewed and merged into the `main` branch
10. Delete your branch

To ensure your pull request is accepted, follow these guidelines:

* All changes should be accompanied by tests
* Do your best to have a [well-formed commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) for your change
* [Keep diffs small](https://graysonkoonce.com/stacked-pull-requests-keeping-github-diffs-small) and self-contained
* If your change fixes a bug, please [link the issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) in your pull request description
* Any changes to the API reference requires [regenerating](#docs) the static `openapi.html` file.

> **Note:** A pull request should generally contain only one commit (use `git commit --amend` and `git push --force` or [squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) existing commits into one).

# Branching

* Use a _group_ at the beginning of your branch names

  ```
  wip      Work on a feature is still in progress
  feature  Add or expand a feature
  bug      Fix a bug
  ```
  
  _For example_:
  
  ```
  wip/my-cool-new-wip-feature
  feature/my-cool-new-feature
  feature/my-other-cool-new-feature
  bug/my-bug-fix
  bug/my-other-bug-fix
  ```
  
* Choose _short_ and _descriptive_ branch names
* Use dashes (`-`) to separate _words_ in branch names
* Use _lowercase_ in branch names

# Sign Your Work

The _sign-off_ is a simple line at the end of the message for a commit. All commits needs to be signed. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the material (see [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org)):

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Remedios Moscote <remedios.moscote@buendÃ­a.com>
```

Git has a [`-s`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```bash
$ git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```

# API [Docs](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/tree/main/docs)

To bundle:

```bash
$ redoc-cli bundle spec/openapi.yml -o docs/openapi.html  --title "Marquez API Reference"
```

To serve:  

```bash
$ redoc-cli serve spec/openapi.yml
```

Then browse to: http://localhost:8080

> **Note:** To bundle or serve the API docs, please install [redoc-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redoc-cli).
