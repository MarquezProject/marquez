# Marquez Airflow - `DEPRECATED`

[![Project status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-orange.svg)]()

This library has been moved to [`OpenLineage/integration/airflow`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/airflow). The `marquez-airflow` library extends the class [`openlineage.airflow.DAG`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/main/integration/airflow/openlineage/airflow/dag.py) for backwards compatibility. **Please use the** [`openlineage-airflow`](https://pypi.org/project/openlineage-airflow) **library instead**.
