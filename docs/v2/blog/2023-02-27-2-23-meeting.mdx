### February 2023 Marquez Community Meeting Highlights

- Announcements: Willy Lulciuc was voted Technical Lead (congrats, Willy!), and the 
LFAI&Data conducted its annual review of the project.
- Recent releases: we released Marquez 0.30.0 and 0.31.0. Read the 
[migration plan](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/blob/main/api/src/main/resources/marquez/db/migration/V57__readme.md) before upgrading to 
0.30.0.
- UI improvements: as demo'ed by Peter Hicks, Marquez now features critical path
highlighting, search functionality and clickable links in column-lineage JSON snippets, a lineage
events viewer, and a soft delete option for datasets and jobs.
- Open discussion: Benji asked if the soft-delete option was available elsewhere
in the UI (not yet, but aggregation of functions is planned), yours truly highlighted an exciting recently added 
[issue](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/issues/2428), and new member Bruno 
Cavestro asked about the project's philosophy, focus on big data tooling, and facets.
