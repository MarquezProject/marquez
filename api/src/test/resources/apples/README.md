My grandmother is an avid cooker. Let's say we are trying to build her a service to help her keep
track of the food she cooks with her recipes. Her recipes are unique to her as they include
pre-prepared ingredients that she made at an earlier point, for example she will make apple pie
filling in the summer to be used all year. My grandmother is always tweaking her recipes to get them
just right. However, last holiday the apple pie my grandmother made tasted off...

This set of open lineage calls features all the things my grandmother makes with apples and features
two different apple picking events. On the second apple picking event, grandma picked crab apples
and added extra sugar to the filling to compensate.
